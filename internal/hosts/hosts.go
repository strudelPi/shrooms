	// normally resolves its hostname to 127.0.1.1, and every daemon that looks
	// itself up — PAM session setup, mail, web servers — expects a local
	// address. Adding an overlay address under the same name gives them a ULA
	// instead, which RFC 6724 will often *prefer*, and which is unroutable
	// entirely until shrooms0 exists. That happens on every boot, before this
	// daemon has started.

// any name only one mesh claimed, which meant the file answered peer.mesh on
// one device and not on another depending on which meshes each had joined —
// the same name meaning different machines, or nothing. An entry with no mesh
// has no name that resolves anywhere, so it is left out rather than written in
// a form nothing else agrees with.
//
// Within a mesh, device names are self-asserted in the announce, so two devices
// can claim the same one. Duplicates get a short piece of their overlay address
// appended, and neither is resolved by last-writer-wins — that silently sends
// your ssh to the wrong machine. Across meshes there is nothing to resolve:
