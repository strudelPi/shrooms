// of library logging that cannot be turned off, and a second Core node joining
// the fleet for the sake of two messages. The daemon is already connected.
//
// The split is the same one the admin key exists for. The daemon holds the
// network key and the connection and never sees the admin key; the CLI holds
// the admin key and signs, and never sees the network key. Neither half can
// admit a device alone.

// invites are the invite topics this node is currently listening on, by content
// topic. Normally empty, and at most one entry outside a test.
