// touched a mesh had to know which it was holding, and the bugs that came out
// of that are listed in docs/one-kind-of-mesh.md — they are all the same bug,
// a per-mesh fact read from a place that predates there being more than one.
//
// Three things it is careful about:
//
// **Interface and port are pinned explicitly**, from the resolved values. After
// this, no mesh's interface or port depends on its position in a sorted list,
// so adding or removing a mesh cannot move another one.
//
// **InheritsIdentity is carried across.** The mesh that was in the top-level
// fields is the one holding this device's pre-multi-mesh keys, and losing that
// would re-derive them, change the node's overlay address and void its
// credential. Implicit before, stated after.
//
// **The device's own settings stay where they are.** Name, base interface and
// port, preset, mode and the relay pins are the device's, not any mesh's.
//
// Refuses rather than merges when the set already names a mesh "default": two
// meshes would claim one label, and picking either silently is how a node ends
// up on a network it was not asked to join.
